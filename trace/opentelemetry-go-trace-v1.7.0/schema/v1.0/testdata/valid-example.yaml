  1.1.0:
    # Section "all" applies to attributes names for all data types: resources, spans, logs,
    # span events, metric labels.
    #
    # The translations in "all" section are performed first (for each particular version).
    # Only after that the translations in the specific section ("resources", "traces",
    # "metrics" or "logs") that corresponds to the data type are applied.
    #
    # The only translation possible in section "all" is renaming of attributes in
    # versions. For human readability versions are listed in reverse chronological
    # order, however note that the translations are applied in the order defined by
    # semver ordering.
